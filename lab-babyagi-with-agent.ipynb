Weather Forecasting is crucial since it helps to determine future climate changes. With the use of latitude, we can determine the probability of snow and hail reaching the surface. We are able to identify the thermal energy from the sun that is exposed to a region. You can follow the Weather Forecast Project to create your own weather application using Weather API. Weather forecasting serves several important purposes: 1. Risk Mitigation: Accurate weather forecasts help individuals, businesses, and governments prepare for and mitigate the impact of adverse weather conditions. This includes preparing for storms, extreme temperatures, or other potentially hazardous weather events. 2. Public Safety: Weather forecasts play a crucial role in public safety by providing advance warning for severe weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods,…', 'votes': 0}, {'link': 'https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-purpose-of-having-an-app-that-predicts-the-weather-during-a-trip-instead-of-checking-outside-before-leaving-home', 'source': 'Quora', 'question': 'What is the purpose of having an app that predicts the weather during a trip instead of checking outside before leaving home?', 'answer': 'Checking outside before you leave home only offers a snapshot of the current conditions at your particular location. Using the app can let you be better prepared for changing conditions there and in other locations. I have personally experienced a front coming through that changed the weather within a walk of a few blocks. When I set out to deliver the morning newspapers, this was in the 70s, the temperature was in the mid 40s so I put on a light jacket. By the time I had walked about 5 city blocks through my neighborhood the temperature had dropped into the 20s and there was a heavy snowstorm with strong winds. At that time there was no such thing as a weather app or I would have checked and known that I needed a heavier coat.

Resource Management: Farmers and agricultural businesses use weather forecasts to make decisions about planting, irrigation, and harvesting.

If the low occurs prior to midnight it is reported as the low for the following day. On the other hand, other parts of the National Weather Service (in this case the Weather Service Forecast Office for Wichita, KS) deem the time from one local midnight to the next to suffice for both the daily high and the daily low.
